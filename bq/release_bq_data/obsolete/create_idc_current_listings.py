'''NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC) (https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/) is a cloud-based environment containing publicly available cancer imaging data co-located with analysis and exploration tools and resources. IDC is a node within the broader NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) (https://datacommons.cancer.gov/) infrastructure that provides secure access to a large, comprehensive, and expanding collection of cancer research data.

IDC curates and shares imaging data in DICOM format, available for download from public Google Cloud Storage buckets. As of v17, IDC contains over 45 TB of imaging data in DICOM format, including radiology and pathology images, image annotations, and various image-derived items (including those generated by AI tools) such as volumetric segmentations, radiomics features and parametric maps.

This dataset provides the searchable index of the metadata accompanying the shared DICOM files. To get started with using this dataset, please see IDC Getting Started tutorials here: https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Tutorials/tree/master/notebooks/getting_started.

Terms of Use: If you use this dataset, please acknowledge IDC as described in this article: https://learn.canceridc.dev/frequently-asked-questions#how-to-acknowledge-idc. If you use the DICOM files referenced from this dataset tables, please use the information about license and attribution assigned on a per-file basis, as described in the Getting Started tutorials: https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Tutorials/tree/master/notebooks/getting_started.'''
