The script creates a list of UUIDs of new instances in --version which start with the --starts_with value. Thus, if --starts_with is '0', then all UUIDs that start with '0' are selected, resulting in a random selection of about one in sixteen instances. A --starts_with value of '00' selects one in 256, etc.\n",
