Scripts in this directory are intended to recover from a DICOM store import that encountered errors.
Specifically, some known set of instances were not imported, while at the same time one or more instances
cannot be import for whatever reason. The result is that the DICOM store and, possibly dicom_metadata BQ
table contain partial series/studies.
So we first remove the instance in the series from dicom_metadata, and then from the DICOM store itself.
We can then upload the previously excluded instance to the DICOM store and then export the metadata of those
instances to BQ.
